  <h2>Opportunity cost</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    When deciding which features to build, it's important to think strategically about <b>opportunity cost</b>. While talking to users to learn about their pain points and needs can be very helpful, you need to remember that users will always have unlimited wants, while Duolingo has limited app real estate and resources. Trying to address every single user need will quickly deplete resources and lead to a cluttered experience.
    <br><br>
    Similarly, while there are countless ways to improve business metrics, only a few ideas are feasible within a given timeframe. It's crucial to weigh not just the immediate gains a feature will generate (such as new users or improved learning), but also the long-term implications of pursuing one feature over another.
    <br><br>
    One common mistake is for a team to launch a feature after discovering it improves a certain metric, without considering the second-order effects of launching the feature. For example, a feature might be very technically complex and end up causing lots of bugs, or may make onboarding to our codebase terribly time-consuming. As you weigh the opportunity cost of a feature, also consider how other teams might be able to better utilize the resources. For example, while launching a new tab might lead to a 1% increase in DAUs, a different team might be able to use that tab space more effectively, such as by launching a feature that increases DAUs by 5% instead.
    <br><br>
    There's ultimately no simple answer for whether a feature that increases metrics is worth launching, but keep in mind that the more resources it requires and the more space it takes up in the user experience, the higher the bar for implementation should be.
