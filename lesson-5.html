  <h1>Lesson 5</h1>
  <h2>Visbility of System Status</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    The design principle of improving visibility of system status is all about making sure users understand what's going on in an app. When users have the information they need, they are better able to respond appropriately to what's happening.
<br><br>
One example of this principle in action is a loading screen. By showing a loading screen when an app is busy, the designer is conveying that no action is expected from the user. This simple indicator can also help reduce user frustration and prevent errors.
<br><br>
Another example is a flashing vertical line in a text field. This subtle indicator tells users that the text field is active and they can start typing. By providing this feedback, the designer is helping users understand what they need to do next. Without it, a user may not know which text field the input may be going to.
<br><br>
When applying this principle, it's important to keep the principle of simplicity in mind. Designers need to convey system status information in a way that is clear but also simple. This will help users understand what's going on without cluttering the app.
