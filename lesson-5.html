  <h1>Lesson 5: Prevent user error</h1>
  <b><p class= "lesson-paragraph" style="text-align: center";>Use force functions to decrease the chances users will make mistakes. Allow users to revert potentially disruptive actions.</p></b>
  <br>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    Mistakes are inevitable, so a well-designed system is forgiving and designed to accommodate user error.
    <br><br>
    User errors can happen for a variety of reasons. <b>Slips</b> occur when the usersâ€™ intentions are appropriate, but they become distracted and do something different than they intended. For instance, they might add salt instead of sugar to coffee. <b>Mistakes</b> occur when the user's intentions are inappropriate given the task at hand. This may be due to inconsistencies between the design and the user's interpretation, such as pulling a door that's meant to be pushed.
    <br><br>
    Good designs anticipate user error and take steps to prevent them while keeping the UI simple and instruction-free.
