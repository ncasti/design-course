  <h2>Make features self-explanatory</h2>
  <h3>Exception to the rule: Hidden affordances</h3>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    Affordances do not always need to be explicit. <b>Hidden affordances</b> are design features that allow for certain interactions, but are not immediately obvious or apparent to users. For example, words with hints on Duolingo are interactive, yet we simply use a gray, dotted line to denote that hints are available.
    <br><br>
    Hidden affordances may come in handy when trying to maintain a clean or minimal aesthetic, or when you want to avoid drawing too much attention to an object. In our lessons, for example, we didn't want learners to over-rely on hints. To discourage this behavior, we intentionally used a hidden affordance â€” even though it made the hints a little harder to discover.
