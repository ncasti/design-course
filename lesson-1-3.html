  <h2>Exception to the rule: Hidden affordances</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    <b>Hidden affordances</b> are design features that allow for certain interactions, but are not immediately obvious or apparent to users. For example, words with hints on Duolingo are interactive, yet we simply use a gray, dotted line to denote that hints are available.
    <br><br>
    Hidden affordances may come in handy when trying to maintain a clean or minimal aesthetic, or when you want to avoid drawing too much attention to an object. In this case, we used a hidden affordance for hints because we didn't want learners to over-rely on them. We did this even though it made the hints a little harder to discover.
