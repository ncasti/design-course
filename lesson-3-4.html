  <h1>Lesson 3: Make good use of visual hierarchy</h1>
  <h2>Placement</h2>
  <br>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    Another way to create hierarchy is through placement. Putting an element at the top of a page or in the center of a composition makes it stand out more than if it were tucked away in a corner. Similarly, designers can use white space (or negative space) to separate elements and make them appear more important.<br><br>
    Colocating elements that are functionally related to each other can also improve the hierarchy of a design. By placing related elements in specific parts of the screen, users can more easily find the information they need. For example, links to other parts of a website are usually located at the top navigation bar, and users looking to navigate to other parts of the app easily know where to go.<br><br>
    To illustrate how placement can affect a design, let's take another look at both versions of Duolingo's home page.

    <img src="assets/content-examples/duolingo-home-new.png">
    By centering the registration and sign in buttons and quite literally surrounding them with “space”, we were able to draw more attention to these important calls to action. We also moved the course flags to the bottom of the screen, as these elements are of relatively lower importance (the user is able to pick a language later, in the onboarding flow). In the old version, many different types of elements were located at the center of the screen, right next to each other, making it hard to understand what was important.
