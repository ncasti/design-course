  <h1>Lesson 6: Visualize system status</h1>
  <h2>Tips & notes</h2>
  <br>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    When designing a new feature, a lot of attention is usually paid to the look of the static design, but we often forget about intermediate steps and the consequences of user interactions with the design. It’s usually not until a feature has been fully implemented and dogfooding or user testing is conducted that the lack of visibility of system status becomes apparent. 
  <br><br>
  To prevent this from happening, you can create <b>clickable prototypes</b> of your design to verify there are no missing parts of the interaction in your spec.
  You could also build a habit around adding <b>“interaction”</b> and <b>“corner cases”</b> sections to your specs. This way, you can make sure you account for what will happen if the user interacts with each UI element.
