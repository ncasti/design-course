  <h2>Additive bias</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    When designing features, it's crucial to be aware of the <b><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/our-brain-typically-overlooks-this-brilliant-problem-solving-strategy/">additive bias</a></b>. This cognitive bias leads us to focus on adding new elements or solutions, rather than considering the removal of existing elements.
    <br><br>
    Removing features can be surprisingly effective. Over time, we have found that old Duolingo features can become irrelevant as newer, better features are introduced. In some cases, removing a feature can actually be a high-ROI way to improve key metrics.
    <br><br>
    For example, when we experimented with discontinuing email reminders for Stories, we found that although Stories engagement decreased, overall app retention and time spent learning both increased. Removing these emails also reduced complexity in the user experience, internal operations, and our codebase. This experiment served as an important reminder that good design isn't just about what you add â€” it's also about what you take away.
