  <h1>Lesson 3: Make good use of visual hierarchy</h1>
  <b><p class= "lesson-paragraph" style="text-align: center";>The intentional use of size, color, and location helps users intuitively focus on elements in order of importance and makes designs aesthetically pleasing.</p></b>

    Take a moment to look at these two screenshots of Duolingo's splash page. Which version do you prefer? Which version do you think is more effective in leading users to create a Duolingo account?

    If you're like most of our users, you probably found the second version to be more aesthetically pleasing, more organized, and more effective in leading people to sign up. The reason? Visual hierarchy.
    <br><br>
    Visual hierarchy refers to the way in which elements are presented to emphasize certain aspects over others. In our current splash page, we use visual hierarchy to more intentionally emphasize the elements that we want users to pay attention to – namely the registration and login buttons. In contrast, the old version had many elements of similar size and vibrant colors competing for users’ attention. What did we want them to look at first? The owl, the sign up buttons, the flags?
    <br><br>
    In this lesson, we’ll cover ways you can use visual hierarchy to more effectively guide the user’s eye through your feature. We’ll discuss how you can use size, placement, color and contrast to create layouts that will help your learner more smoothly navigate your new design.
