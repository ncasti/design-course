  <h1>Lesson 2: Be consistent</h1>
  <h2>Juicy</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    When it comes to internal consistency, one of the best resources we have is our own design system, Juicy. By using the components and guidelines provided in Juicy, we can ensure that our products maintain a cohesive look and feel. This is important not only for user experience, but also for brand recognition. When our users see a design that is consistent with our brand, they will be more likely to trust our product and engage with it.

It is a great resource for designers and engineers alike, and it is a great way to ensure that your designs are consistent with the rest of the company.
