  <h1>Lesson 2: Be consistent</h1>
  <h2>Internal consistency</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    Design is <b>internally consistent</b> when design patterns are consistently applied every time you encounter the same type of design problem. We’ve seen how consistency improves the user experience, but internal consistency also reduces complexity and increases the ROI of your solution.

    Better component reusability leads to faster design and implementation processes that are easier to maintain. By being internally consistent, designers can quickly duplicate existing Figma components and simply swap out copy and assets, rather than starting from scratch. Software engineers, on the other hand, can also implement a style or layout once and reuse that code in a variety of applications. This reduces ideation, design, QA, and implementation time, as well as minimizes the probability of new bugs.

    Duolingo's “unified home message system” is a perfect example of how to leverage consistency to create more user-friendly and scalable designs. The system's limited rules make it easy to display different messages to learners without creating complexity in the code or user experience. This is a marked improvement from our previous approach, which allowed different teams to add messages with varied implementations, sometimes resulting in bugs or unexpected interactions.
