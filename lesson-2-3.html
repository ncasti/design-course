  <h1>Lesson 2: Be consistent</h1>
  <h2>Internal consistency</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    Design is <b>internally consistent</b> when you apply the same design patterns every time you encounter the same type of design problem. We've seen how consistency improves the user experience, but internal consistency also reduces complexity and increases the ROI of your solution.

    Internal consistency enables better component reusability, which in turn accelerates the design and implementation processes. By duplicating existing Figma components, designers can quickly swap out copy and assets instead of iterating on and conducting UXR on different design solutions from scratch. Similarly, software engineers can reuse code for a variety of applications, saving implementation time and minimizing the emergence of new bugs.
    <br><br>
    Our session end screens are a good example of internal consistency. We use the same layout for each session end screen so that learners can easily parse information and quickly continue on with their learning. For example, assets are always the same size, buttons are consistently placed at the bottom of the screen, and the copy for "continue" buttons is always the same.
