  <h1>Lesson 2: Be consistent</h1>
  <h2>Design conventions</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">

    <b>Design conventions</b> are common patterns or rules that appear in popular applications. Design conventions provide consistency for users across their entire mobile experience. If all apps follow the same design conventions, users will have an easier time understanding how to interact with them, decreasing cognitive load.<br><br>
    One common design convention for mobile applications is how the "X" button, which allows users to exit out of a screen, is usually located in the top left corner. By following this convention, users can easily locate the button to close a screen, no matter what app they are using.

    Many design conventions feel so obvious to us today, we don't even think about them. For example, we often use red text to denote an error, and green text to denote success. Users quickly learn to associate these colors with certain outcomes, so following this convention helps users understand what is happening – no tutorial or instruction needed.

    Design conventions also exist for copy. For example, a page that contains a user's avatar, their username, and other basic information, is usually called a “profile”. Calling it something different, like "Learner's hub" may indeed be more creative and fun, but it would be harder to interpret and could lead to confusion.
