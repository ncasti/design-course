  <h1>Lesson 3: Make good use of visual hierarchy</h1>
  <h2>Size</h2>
  <br>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    One of the primary ways to create a sense of hierarchy is through size. By making one element larger than the others, you draw attention to it. While this sounds obvious, this simple fact can be easily overlooked in the design process.
    <br><br>
    Take a look at this screenshot of the mobile home screen of Williams Sonoma. Other than the Cyber Monday banner, all the elements are of similar size, resulting in a busy page with information that is hard to interpret.

    Now take a look at the Apple Card mobile website. Here, three discrete sizes are used to convey different levels of importance.
    <img src="assets/content-examples/apple-card.jpeg" style="max-width: 300px;">
    The largest element on the screen is the Apple Card logo, which helps us quickly understand what this screen is about. The second largest element, the “Apply now” button right below the title, makes it clear that this is the core action to be taken on this screen. Finally, the elements in the top navigation and bottom banner are significantly smaller, conveying that this is nonessential information that can be safely ignored unless the user wishes to do or learn more.
