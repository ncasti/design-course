  <h1>Lesson 6</h1>
  <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    In design, hierarchy refers to the way in which elements are arranged to emphasize certain aspects over others. Hierarchy can be applied to any type of design, from graphic design to web design to architecture.
    <br><br>
    One of the primary ways designers create hierarchy is through size. By making one element larger than the others, they can draw attention to it. For example, a company logo might be the largest item on a web page, signifying its importance.
    <br><br>
    Another way designers create hierarchy is through placement. Putting an element at the top of a page or in the center of a composition makes it stand out more than if it were tucked away in a corner. Similarly, designers can use white space (or negative space) to separate elements and make them appear more important.
    <br><br>
    Color can also be used to create hierarchy. Bright or contrasting colors will draw attention to certain elements, while muted colors will recede into the background. The use of color can also work in tandem with size and placement to create even stronger hierarchies.
    <br><br>
    Typographic hierarchy is another important aspect of design. Designers can use font size, weight, and style to indicate which parts of a text are most important. For example, a headline will often be in a larger font size than the body text, while a subheading might be in a slightly smaller font size but in a bolder weight.
    <br><br>
    Ultimately, hierarchy is about guiding the viewer's eye to the most important parts of a design. By using a combination of size, placement, color, and typography, designers can create effective hierarchies that help communicate their message.
