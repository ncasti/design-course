  <h3>Affordances</h3>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    One way to make things easy to use is through the careful use of <b>affordances</b>. Affordances are the ways in which an object or system can be used. For example, buttons in our UI imitate real-life buttons and afford being tapped. This is called an <b>explicit affordance</b>, as the way to interact with this UI element is made obvious or clear to users. 
    <br><br>
    Conversely, when we want to convey that a button is not tappable, we remove the button shadow and gray it out. This is called a <b>negative affordance</b>. Negative affordances make it difficult or impossible for users to interact with an object or system.
