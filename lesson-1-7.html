  <h1>Lesson 1: Make things self-explanatory</h1>
  <h2>Tips and notes</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    <b>Remember:</b> <br>
    1. Make good use of affordances and signifiers so that features are discoverable and the purpose of each element is immediately obvious to the user.<br>
    2. Avoid explicit instructions – the way app mechanics and UI elements work should be self-explanatory.
    <br><br>
    <b>Tips:</b><br>
    1. If you’ve participated in the design or ideation of a feature, you may be the worst person to judge whether your design is self-explanatory. You’ve likely been primed to interpret the design in a particular way. Instead, run usability studies to see if users are able to correctly interpret your design.<br>
    2. If conducting usability studies is not feasible, be skeptical of your own design and ask yourself: Would your grandparents understand how to use this?<br>
    3. Have a high bar when interpreting user feedback. You may find that learners are indeed able to understand your design, but only after reading instructions, thinking, or experimenting with it. The best designs are immediately obvious; ideally there is no guessing or thinking involved.
