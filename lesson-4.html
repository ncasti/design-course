  <h1>Lesson 4</h1>
  <h2>Preventing User Error</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    When designing mobile apps, it's important to anticipate and prevent user errors as much as possible.
    <br><br>
    One way that designers can prevent user errors is by making it difficult or impossible for users to make mistakes in the first place. For example, in a shopping app that requires users to select a delivery date, you may choose to use a calendar picker instead of a text field. This way, users won't be able to enter an invalid date, which could lead to delays or missed deliveries. By using a calendar picker, the designer is preventing user error before it happens.
