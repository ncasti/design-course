  <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
  <p class ="lesson-paragraph">
    1. Use and study popular apps (e.g. Twitter, Gmail, Instagram, TikTok) to gain an intuitive understanding of the design conventions our learners are likely already familiar with.<br><br>
    2. When adding a new type of interaction on Duolingo, make sure to check out our Juicy Design System and take screenshots of how other apps handle that interaction. Pay attention to the layout, navigation, and iconography used and consider how you could repurpose them in your design.<br><br>
    3. Keep your team focused and avoid the temptation to implement icons or layouts that deviate from conventions because they “look more fun” or you want to be original.
