        People only have so much brain power. This means that the more they pay attention to one topic, the less they'll be able to pay attention to others. This concept is called <b>cognitive load</b> â€” someone can only sustain a limited amount of mental effort before becoming tired, overwhelmed, or distracted.
        <br><br>
        Great designers know this and do not simply intend to make things look attractive. Instead, great designers make sure features are also easy to use and understand. When design is self-explanatory, we free up users' mental space that would otherwise be devoted to learning the UI. In the case of Duolingo, where we help others learn something new, intuitive design is paramount to help learners use their cognitive resources effectively.
        <br><br>
        To make features self-explanatory, we rely on visual cues and affordances that eliminate the need for tutorials, long explanations, or tooltips that would waste precious mental effort.
